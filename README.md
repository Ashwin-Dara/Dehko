# Pragma 

## Utils - Design Features 
- Will be able to play music from YouTube
- Example commands. `please play music ~link` `play music ~link` `could you please tune a jam ~link`
- It will be inconveniant in terms of user design if they cant play music without the link 

FEATURE: play music based on the song. Will need to play the top result from the name. This is low priority. 
FEATURE: curate playlists from YouTube API. Alongside a recommendation system, this would be very good. 
FEATURE: Will send nice dashboard of the current song that is playing (maybe try to retrieve more information from spotify? Need to figure out how to send a nicely formatting image that retrieves the thumbnail and everything) 

## Weather 
- Example commands `what is the temperature` 
- Output: should give a nice visual dashboard depending on the area that you are in. It will give day's forecast by default. 

## Radio 
- curate the playlist 

## Reminders
- make this an exact command. Should not be something left to NLP/Classification.
`~remind 1hr "tell me to check this"`
`~remind 1:30hr "Check the forecast"`

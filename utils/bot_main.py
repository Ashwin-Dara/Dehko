# Overview of Message Flow
"""
---------- RECEIVING

1. Recieve a message from the users within the server.
2. Check if the message is directed towards the bot.
    - We will be able to do this via a special message structure.
    - @bot_name message...
3. If the message is directed towards the bot, we need to do some processing

---------- PROCESSING

1. Remove the @bot_name from the message string
2. If anything is enclosed around ~ https//:youtube.com... ~, it is a link. Store is as a corresponding "argument" pair
    - remove the link from the message
3. Classify the message.

----------- RESPONSE

1. Perform the appropriate action. Send Follow up messages if needed.
2. For the weather, think of a way to extract the city name out of the current text. May be difficult and need some autocorrelation.
3. Use the NLPModel class and the CommandModel class

------------ ANALYZE
1. Store the command that was called and the associated user
2. Store key phrases (similar to the zkie bot project)
